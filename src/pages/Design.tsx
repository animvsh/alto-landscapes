            <div className="space-y-4 text-alto-dark-gray">
              <p>
                In the world of accessory dwelling units (ADUs), the term "ADU designer" covers a wide range of professionals, each offering different skills and expertise. Unlike traditional roles with more defined qualifications, ADU design is a diverse field. You might come across the term "ADU specialist," which can sometimes be earned with minimal testing. However, the true mark of an ADU designer's ability lies not in certifications but in their experienceâ€”handling the complexities of ADU projects on a daily basis.
              </p>
              <p>
                An experienced ADU designer specializes in creating and planning ADUs, understanding the unique challenges and regulations involved. These professionals excel in optimizing limited spaces, ensuring compliance with local zoning laws, and designing ADUs that balance comfort, functionality, and aesthetics. They work closely with homeowners to create custom designs tailored to specific needsâ€”whether for rental income, multigenerational living, or increasing property value. From concept development and 3D renderings to construction drawings and material selections, ADU designers ensure that each project aligns with the homeowner's vision, budget, and regulatory requirements.
              </p>
              <p className="font-semibold text-alto-blue">
                At Alto ADU, we go beyond designâ€”we are full-service ADU design-build experts.
              </p>
              <p>
                This distinction is important in a field where theoretical knowledge isn't enough without hands-on experience. Our integrated approach covers design, permitting, and construction, providing a seamless process from concept to completion. This model not only simplifies the process but also ensures a higher level of accountability and efficiency compared to standalone designers or architects.
